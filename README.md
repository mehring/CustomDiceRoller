CustomDiceRoller
================

Create custom dice and custom dice rolls. This is an angular app and it does not require a DB connection or any server side code. This allows you to run it without a web server. To save your custom dice, the app will save a .JSON file to your computer which you must put in the root directory of the app. When you refresh or load the app again, your data is there.
